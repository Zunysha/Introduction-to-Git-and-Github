# Intro to git and Github

Git and GitHub are essential tools in modern software development, enabling collaborative coding, version control, and efficient project management. Let's start with an introduction to both Git and GitHub:

## **Git:**
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a software project efficiently. It tracks changes to source code and other project files over time, making it easier to manage different versions of your project and collaborate with others. Instead of having a single centralized repository, Git uses a distributed model, allowing each contributor to have a full copy of the project's history on their local machine.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Repository (Repo):** A repository is a collection of files and their complete history. It contains the entire project, including all code, documentation, and configuration files.

2. **Commit:** A commit is a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. Each commit records changes made to files, along with a unique identifier, timestamp, and a message describing the changes.

3. **Branch:** A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. It allows developers to work on features, fixes, or experiments without affecting the main project until ready.

4. **Merge:** Merging combines changes from one branch into another. This is how developers integrate their work back into the main project.

5. **Pull Request (PR):** A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch (usually a feature branch) into another (often the main branch). It allows for code review and discussion before the changes are merged.

## **GitHub:**
GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git that provides additional features for collaboration, project management, and code hosting. It offers a visually friendly interface to interact with Git repositories, simplifying many development workflows.

#### Key Features:
1. **Remote Repository:** GitHub hosts remote repositories where your codebase is stored. This allows multiple developers to access and collaborate on the same project from different locations.

2. **Issue Tracking:** GitHub provides an issue tracking system to manage tasks, bugs, and enhancements. Developers can create, assign, and track issues throughout the development process.

3. **Pull Requests:** GitHub's pull request feature allows developers to submit their changes for review and merge. It includes features like comments, code reviews, and continuous integration (CI) checks.

4. **Collaboration:** GitHub makes it easy for developers to collaborate on projects. They can fork repositories, work on their changes in their own branches, and submit pull requests to contribute back to the original project.

5. **GitHub Pages:** GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository.

In summary, Git is the version control system that tracks changes to your codebase, while GitHub is a platform that facilitates collaboration, code hosting, and project management using Git repositories. Together, they provide the foundation for efficient and collaborative software development.
